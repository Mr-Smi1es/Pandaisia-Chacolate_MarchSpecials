# CASE-REVIEW: Review Assignment

## Anne wants you to work on another page for the Pandaisia Chocolates website. This page will contain information on some of the specials offered by the company in March; it will also display a list of some awards that the company has won. As you work on the page, you will use clip art images as placeholders until photographs of the awards are available.

---

### Anne has already created the page content and some of the design styles to be used in the page. Your job will be to come up with the CSS style sheet to set the page layout. Complete the following:

- [x] Use your editor to open the pc_specials_txt.html and pc_specials_txt.css files from the html03 ► review folder. Enter your name and the date in the comment section of each file, and save them as pc_specials.html and pc_specials.css respectively.

- [x] Go to the pc_specials.html file in your editor. Within the document head, create links to the pc_reset2.css, pc_styles4.css, and pc_specials.css style sheets.

- [x] Go to the pc_specials.html file in your editor. Within the document head, create links to the pc_reset2.css, pc_styles4.css, and pc_specials.css style sheets.

- [x] Go to the pc_specials.css file in your editor. Within the Page Body Styles section, add a style rule for the body element that sets the width of the page body to 95% of the browser window width within the range of 640 to 960 pixels. Horizontally center the page body within the window by setting the left and right margins to auto.

- [x] Go to the Image Styles section and create a style rule that displays all img
      elements as blocks with a width of 100%.

- [x] Anne wants the navigation list to be displayed horizontally on the page. Go to
      the Horizontal Navigation Styles section and create a style rule for every list
      item within a horizontal navigation list that displays the list item as a block
      floated on the left margin with a width of 16.66%.

- [x] Display every hypertext link nested within a navigation list item as a block.

- [x] Next, you will create the grid styles for the March Specials page. Go to the
      Grid Styles section and create a style rule for the body element that displays
      the element as a grid with two columns in the proportion of 2:1 (using fr
      units) with a column grid gap of 20 pixels.

- [x] Create a style rule for the header and footer elements that has both
  elements span the grid from the gridline number 1 to gridline number −1.

- [x] Create a style rule for the section element with the id “sub” that displays that
  element as a grid consisting of three columns of equal width by repeating the
  column width 1fr three times.

- [x] Go to the Specials Styles section. In this section, you will create styles for the
  monthly specials advertised by the company. Create a style rule for all div
  elements of the specials class that sets the minimum height to 400 pixels and
  adds a 1 pixel dashed outline around the element with a color value of rgb(71,
  52, 29).

- [] Go to the Award Styles section. In this section, you will create styles for the
  list of awards won by Pandaisia Chocolates. Information boxes for the awards
  are placed within an aside element. Create a style rule for the aside
  element that places it using relative positioning, sets its height to 650 pixels,
  and automatically displays scrollbars for any overflow content.

- [] Every information box in the aside element is stored in a div element.
  Create a style rule that places these elements with absolute positioning and
  sets their width to 30%.

- [] Position the individual awards within the awardList box by creating style rules
  for the div elements with id values ranging from award1 to award5 at the
  following (top, left) coordinates: award1 (80px, 5%), award2 (280px, 60%),
  award3 (400px, 20%), award4 (630px, 45%), and award5 (750px, 5%). (Hint:
  In the pc_specials.html file, the five awards have been placed in a div
  element belonging to the awards class with id values ranging from award1 to
  award5.)

- [] Save your changes to the style sheet and then open the pc_specials.html
  file in your browser. Verify that the layout and design styles resemble the page
  shown in Figure 3–83.
